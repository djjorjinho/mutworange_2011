UPDATE 1
--------
24/03/2011
Changed the plonk/website/controller.php file. Added an extra function doMain() so it's more easy
to call a static function (which is located in the core/includes/functions.php) that is needed in the layout.tpl. I did this so it's possible to
put the login/search form in the header.
This function is only called when the name of an action starts with 'main' 
and is only needed when you need a function that can't be implemented in the modules/[name_module]/[name_module].php file
