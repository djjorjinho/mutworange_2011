Pedro (PT): (19:31) was Zvez able to run the application? or you?
Nathan: (19:31) but 10.00 they will be up and running
Nathan: (19:31) *by
Daniel (PT): (19:31) ok make sure you follow integration conventions
Ina: (19:31) i think he run it
Ina: (19:32) but you are talking about the website??
Pedro (PT): (19:32) yes
Pedro (PT): (19:32) it was the problem he had last time
Pedro (PT): (19:32) well i would like to make a request then
Pedro (PT): (19:33) as soon as you meet him
Pedro (PT): (19:33) ask him to give the more complet report by email
Pedro (PT): (19:33) with the complete % also
Ina: (19:33) ok
Pedro (PT): (19:33) thanks
Daniel (PT): (19:34) thank you pedro
Daniel (PT): (19:34) ok issues?
Stephane: (19:34) Daniel, what you mean by 'integration conventions'?
Daniel (PT): (19:34) you dumped a new version of database under a new name
Daniel (PT): (19:34) i didn't know which one to use
Daniel (PT): (19:35) but then i got it
Stephane: (19:35) ah okay, like that.
Daniel (PT): (19:35) from your commit messages
Stephane: (19:35) sorry man 
Daniel (PT): (19:35) no problem seriously
Stephane: (19:35) thought it would be clear 
Daniel (PT): (19:36) I didn't even mention it
Daniel (PT): (19:36) when we pass the app to the other servers we need to know which scripts need to be run
Daniel (PT): (19:37) ok issues?
Stephane: (19:37) ok :)
Stephane: (19:37) i have a request, but it's for germany :/
Stephane: (19:37) and a question for greece
Daniel (PT): (19:37) their late
Daniel (PT): (19:38) ask greece
Pedro (PT): (19:38) stephane a question, which funtionalitys of the infox were tested?
Pedro (PT): (19:38) simple comunication or are already some protocols defined
stefanos (Greece): (19:39) what ?:P
Pedro (PT): (19:39) did they just test sending random information between servers by infox
Stephane: (19:39) first greece
Pedro (PT): (19:39) or do they have the process of adding an institution complete for example
Stephane: (19:39) we need to ingerate you modules into the website, wondering if you wanted to do that, or you want us to do that?
Pedro (PT): (19:39) oh the what was to him nvm then
Stephane: (19:39) and about the infox testing
Stephane: (19:40) they have a static form where you can select the tables and the values you want to send
Stephane: (19:40) that's good for an admin, but it should be transparant for the other users

Daniel (PT): (19:27) can we see them?
Daniel (PT): (19:27) why didn0t we know?

Pedro (PT): (19:38) simple comunication or are already some protocols defined
stefanos (Greece): (19:39) what ?:P
Pedro (PT): (19:39) did they just test sending random information between servers by infox
Stephane: (19:39) first greece
Pedro (PT): (19:39) or do they have the process of adding an institution complete for example

stefanos (Greece): (19:40) i believe its better you to ingerate them...
stefanos (Greece): (19:41) i havent studied other codes...
Daniel (PT): (19:41) infox is a web form
stefanos (Greece): (19:41) integrate
Daniel (PT): (19:41) ?
stefanos (Greece): (19:41) ?
Stephane: (19:42) now i'm lost too
Daniel (PT): (19:42) forget it go on, ill test later
Pedro (PT): (19:43) you shouldn't need to study the others code
Pedro (PT): (19:43) only if your talking about plonk but doesn't seem so
stefanos (Greece): (19:43) about the modules
stefanos (Greece): (19:44) i suppose there is a admin panel thats active when the id is an coordinator
Stephane: (19:44) yes
stefanos (Greece): (19:44) so you just add it there right?
stefanos (Greece): (19:44) (i dont want to mess with others codes)
Pedro (PT): (19:45) as is i believe
Pedro (PT): (19:45) you have to put something like a check logged
Pedro (PT): (19:45) and depending on their level
Stephane: (19:45) want to add what?
Pedro (PT): (19:45) you active an option that is laready included in the main template
Pedro (PT): (19:46) o Logged, oAdmin etc i beleive
Stephane: (19:46) yes
stefanos (Greece): (19:46) stephan can you put them on?
Pedro (PT): (19:46) in other words its all code in your page so in the worst case
Pedro (PT): (19:46) you won't change the otehrs code
Arne R.: (19:47) good evening guys
Daniel (PT): (19:47) i suppose you can arranja a date and discuss this?
Daniel (PT): (19:47) belgium help out greece
Daniel (PT): (19:48) arranje internally a date
Stephane: (19:49) aaaight
Daniel (PT): (19:49) cool thnks Stephane
Stephane: (19:49) no problem :)
Daniel (PT): (19:49) hi everybody. Its Nuno
Daniel (PT): (19:49) I must leave now
Daniel (PT): (19:50) We will set a server to deploy ErasmusLinbe here as Daniel already mentioned
stefanos (Greece): (19:50) ok
Daniel (PT): (19:50) Apparently things are running well; however I hgot a little concerned with Infox. I was not sure if it can work in a trasparent way
Daniel (PT): (19:51) please just check tha among yoursefves
Daniel (PT): (19:51) Try also to find some time to start writing a draft report so you cab easily produce the final document in the end
Stephane: (19:51) I was going to ask that to Germany today :)
Daniel (PT): (19:52) I will try to attend one or two more meetings. In the meanwhile keep on with the good work
Daniel (PT): (19:52) Pedro, I hope you recover fast
Daniel (PT): (19:52) Greetings everubo
stefanos (Greece): (19:52) bye
Stephane: (19:52) bye
Nathan: (19:52) bye
stefanos (Greece): (19:52) stephan can you add my modules?
stefanos (Greece): (19:52) or can you tell me how?
Stephane: (19:53) we need to discuss that
Stephane: (19:53) we can do it, but that you can make some more form (internship) but I don't want to give all the form work to you :)
stefanos (Greece): (19:54) whats this?
Stephane: (19:54) sentence makes any sense?
stefanos (Greece): (19:54) you want me to make a form?
Stephane: (19:55) well, if you want to inegrate the modules yourself, we can do something else (like integrating the infox so it's transparent to the user) or create internship forms (although we still don't have those)
