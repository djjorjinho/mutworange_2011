daniel.lopes (PT): (18:26) cool dude
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:26) so if it's a success you can get a job at the college?
Stephane 2: (18:27) no, it's just an alternative for doing internship at a company
Stephane 2: (18:27) they have no need for teachers or it crowd as far as i know
Pedro (PT): (18:28) b
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:28) waiting for the germans I guess
Stephane 2: (18:29) yes
Stephane 2: (18:30) don't know if arne lipfert will be joining
Pedro (PT): (18:30) digital signatures not being a problem seems fishy to me
Pedro (PT): (18:31) in my opinion for now not every1 will agree
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:35) look, If we get too close to deadline we're gonna have to decide on an easier solution
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:35) but you have to admit It would be awsome
Stephane 2: (18:36) it damn would be :)
Stephane 2: (18:37) but we should start with the actual meeting now I think
Pedro (PT): (18:38) shoot then
Stefanos (Greece): (18:38) +1
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:38) go
Stephane 2: (18:38) I hope i'm not the only one who wants to add/change something to the db :/
Stephane 2: (18:40) should we use voice or?
Pedro (PT): (18:40) any1 good for me
Stephane 2: (18:40) think it would be best if we should all use voice
Pedro (PT): (18:40) but until any suggestions are made you might not need the shared screen for now
Stephane 2: (18:40) ah okay
Stephane 2: (18:41) than I have a first suggestion
Stefanos (Greece): (18:41) no voice
Stephane 2: (18:41) adding a companies table to the database
Stefanos (Greece): (18:41) i dont have speakers but i'll follow you..
Stefanos (Greece): (18:41) :/
ageliki: (18:42) companies?
Stephane 2: (18:42) ah okee
ageliki: (18:42) u mean for internships?
Stephane 2: (18:42) we have an institution table
Stephane 2: (18:42) but students can also go to companies
Pedro (PT): (18:42) can you break down info about a company that is consisntent?
Pedro (PT): (18:42) if not it might not be necessary
Stephane 2: (18:43) hmm, maybe
Stephane 2: (18:43) problem is i don't know what info need to be saved of a company
Stefanos (Greece): (18:43) maybe it shoold be boolean in the institution table
Pedro (PT): (18:43) if not its just a name or description, and considering it wont repeat that much
Stephane 2: (18:43) but you're probably right it can be in the same table
Pedro (PT): (18:44) beter be just a column
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:44) you can save address, phone, email about a company
Pedro (PT): (18:44) and how will you get that
Pedro (PT): (18:44) does that info ocme from the forms?
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:45) does it?
Stephane 2: (18:45) we asked out IO coordinator today for those forms and she was going to send us those
Stephane 2: (18:45) our*
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:46) does the student just requests a internship mobility and the IO sends a list of companies?
Stephane 2: (18:46) maybe a system where: if the company is not in the database it will be added when you fill it in so it can be used in the future?
Pedro (PT): (18:47) ok
Pedro (PT): (18:47) but now picture this theres a versus the amount of info that a companie holds
Pedro (PT): (18:47) and the amount of repetitions
Stephane 2: (18:47) she told us you don't need partnerships with companies
Pedro (PT): (18:47) if both are low, a new table isnt justifiable i say
Stephane 2: (18:48) so no new table?
Stephane 2: (18:48) and as stefanos said, a boolean?
Pedro (PT): (18:49) qdo we get the name in the forms? if yes why avoid storing it
Stephane 2: (18:49) don't get the question :/
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:49) so you're going to take the name and check the yellow pages?
Stefanos (Greece): (18:50) we can set it as a varchar also, in case we want to add something else in the future, except from company/intitution, for greater detail
Stephane 2: (18:50) i'm not following here
Stephane 2: (18:50) the part about the varchar i get
Stephane 2: (18:51) but the part about checking the name?
Pedro (PT): (18:52) it was him being funy ignore
Stefanos (Greece): (18:52) we can save the names, and later an administrator can filter them and add them to the db
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:53) no i was making a point
Stephane 2: (18:53) please explain than because i'm not following :/
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:53) if you save the company name, addresse every time, it loses integrity
Stephane 2: (18:53) if it's not in it than save it
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:54) save it in another table? ok
Stephane 2: (18:55) save it in the same table, no? that's what pedro said no?
Pedro (PT): (18:55) as i sayd
Pedro (PT): (18:55) i ponted out if its only a name and it probably wont be used many times
Pedro (PT): (18:55) maybe isnt necessary
Pedro (PT): (18:56) example
Pedro (PT): (18:56) you use a key for mobility type
Pedro (PT): (18:56) and in its table its only a description
Pedro (PT): (18:56) but you know its only 3-4 types
Pedro (PT): (18:56) repeated over and over
Pedro (PT): (18:56) a new table inst wrong
Pedro (PT): (18:56) jsut saying it maight not be necessary
Pedro (PT): (18:56) its up to you
Stephane 2: (18:57) it's up to all of us :)
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:57) 'might' doesn't seem right
Arne R 2: (18:57) hey guys, sorry for my delay. i had a big problem with my car and had to take it to the workshop
Stephane 2: (18:58) no problem
Arne R 2: (18:58) my key got stuck in the lock that i could'nt get it out...i had to wait for the emergency service to take it to the workshop







Arne R 2: (18:58) my key got stuck in the lock that i could'nt get it out...i had to wait for the emergency service to take it to the workshop
daniel.lopes (PT): (18:59) that sucks
Stefanos (Greece): (18:59) yep..
Stephane 2: (18:59) indeed
Arne R 2: (19:00) terrible afternoon, i had to wait 3 hours beside my car...
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:00) ok we we're discussing including a company table in the database and if it's necessary
Arne R 2: (19:00) ok, i read the logs
Stephane 2: (19:00) 3 hours :/
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:01) you can have more than one student in the same company, if you have a company table you just save the company id in the student's process
Stephane 2: (19:01) indeed
Stephane 2: (19:01) the same for an institution
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:02) exactly
Stephane 2: (19:02) so, 1 table for both (i really like the idea now :) )
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:02) company is an entity
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:03) even if you don't save a lot of info, it pays to have a separate table
Stephane 2: (19:03) hm
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:03) ok let's vote ;)
Stephane 2: (19:04) can you say why it pays to have a separate table?
Stephane 2: (19:04) but maybe it's better
Stephane 2: (19:04) because we're having the problem of centralizing the institutions and companies can be added on the fly
Stephane 2: (19:04) didn't consider that
Pedro (PT): (19:05) ' because we're having the problem of centralizing the institutions' what problems?
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:05) the companies normaly revolve around the institution right?
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:06) consider it a contact list
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:06) the payoff is integrity
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:06) you have one company info instead of thousands for every student application
Arne R 2: (19:07) i think we have to find out what kind of data has to be stored especially for a company
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:07) chances are you are going to use a small number of companies in a semester
Arne R 2: (19:07) if there is much more special information it has to be a seperate table
Stephane 2: (19:07) @Arne: the problem is we still don't know that because we don't have the forms
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:07) but you are going to repeat them over the years
Arne R 2: (19:07) ok so the question could not be answered.
Arne R 2: (19:08) yet
Stephane 2: (19:08) not really
Pedro (PT): (19:08) just go with seperated
Pedro (PT): (19:08) the reasons to not keep it separated are way to restrictive
Pedro (PT): (19:08) and since we dont have enouth info about it
Stephane 2: (19:08) separated it is
Pedro (PT): (19:08) the separated can handle any changes
Arne R 2: (19:09) I tend to seperated tables, too
Pedro (PT): (19:09) greece?
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:10) just think of what kind of information the IO needs to have to contact and control the companies
ageliki: (19:11) actually i wanted to ask if there is any country which has seperate sheet for intenships
Arne R 2: (19:11) my thought is that it is a seperate entity so we have to add a seperate table...
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:11) gotta go dudes
Stephane 2: (19:11) you're coming back or?
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:11) got a class coming
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:12) maybe not... only finishes at 22:30pm :(
Stephane 2: (19:12) ouch
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:12) Auf Wiederzehen
Stephane 2: (19:13) for now i copies the institution tables and changed the name to cOMPANIES
Stephane 2: (19:13) BYE
Arne R 2: (19:13) wiedersehen ;)
Stephane 2: (19:13) COPIED$
daniel.lopes (PT): (19:13) sorry... still learning :P
Pedro (PT): (19:13) ageliki on that i cant help you
Stefanos (Greece): (19:13) my dsl went down
Pedro (PT): (19:13) stephane is the one collecting forms
Pedro (PT): (19:14) is still want my awnser on this ' because we're having the problem of centralizing the institutions' what problems?
Stephane 2: (19:14) we asked our IO coordinator for the forms and she would send them to us
Stephane 2: (19:14) so for now we play the waiting game
Pedro (PT): (19:14) you collected all our forms, i cant check em now because the link is ffline but was there any one making a distinction?






Pedro (PT): (19:14) you collected all our forms, i cant check em now because the link is ffline but was there any one making a distinction?
Stephane 2: (19:16) I have no problems with centralising the institutions but I think it would be hard to have the companies and institutions in the same table because companies can be added on the fly while institutions need to be confirmed by partnership
Stephane 2: (19:16) if that makes any sense
Pedro (PT): (19:16) ok
Pedro (PT): (19:16) then write better dam it :P
Stephane 2: (19:16) srr :(
Arne R 2: (19:17) companies are now a seperate table. let's go on to the next topic
Stephane 2: (19:17) so i created an extra table now
Stephane 2: (19:17) check
Stephane 2: (19:18) another thing was
Stephane 2: (19:18) now with the centralised database of the institutions you have to copy that info to the db of the school
Stephane 2: (19:19) but you also need to copy which studies you can follow at that school and which courses
Stephane 2: (19:19) i'm not seeing quite how this should be implemented
Pedro (PT): (19:20) did you read the email
Pedro (PT): (19:20) i sent today about deployment?
Stephane 2: (19:20) yes
Stephane 2: (19:20) i'm not talking about the ticket
Pedro (PT): (19:20) i did say that not having a central DB would be better
Pedro (PT): (19:20) and that we have to ocnsider that the info about other institutions needs to be stored
Pedro (PT): (19:20) or is accessed wenever needed
Pedro (PT): (19:21) now you have to picture all this info fragmented and if its needed to replicate it or not
Pedro (PT): (19:22) if it is when you added a new partners both would get the info about each other by infox
Pedro (PT): (19:22) for example
Stephane 2: (19:24) so no central database?
Stephane 2: (19:24) or am i reading it completely wrong
Pedro (PT): (19:24) as i sayd in the email i belive a entral DB for now
Pedro (PT): (19:24) isnt justified
Pedro (PT): (19:24) for sayd reasons there
Arne R 2: (19:24) i think pedro means that there will be a central db which only holds the contact information of all institutions
Pedro (PT): (19:25) but the point of it is for every1 to think and form their opinion
Pedro (PT): (19:25) unfortunaly i cant be right on this by myself
Arne R 2: (19:25) and the infox gets the contact information from this db to send the data to the right institution
Arne R 2: (19:25) this is how arne and me think about it and how we design it
Pedro (PT): (19:26) yes arne theres that way
Arne R 2: (19:26) there should be no legal issues in this solution because no personal data is stored
Pedro (PT): (19:26) but considering you only contact isntitutions that you have partenrship with
Arne R 2: (19:26) just "gateways" to the right servers
Arne R 2: (19:26) yep
Pedro (PT): (19:26) we can avoid it and the administrator adds the link manualy
Pedro (PT): (19:26) when they do the partning up however they do it
Arne R 2: (19:27) we agree with pedros deployment thoughts
Pedro (PT): (19:29) and the others
Pedro (PT): (19:29) you have knowledge on tyhe problem that i dont have
Pedro (PT): (19:29) what kind of info might be needed etc
Pedro (PT): (19:29) lets blossom some problems and solutions gogo
Stefanos (Greece): (19:30) :D
Stephane 2: (19:30) hmm
Stephane 2: (19:31) i'm trying to see it, we already had a brainstorm session about the problem of adding an institution
Stephane 2: (19:31) seems i've lost some parts of it
Stephane 2: (19:32) everything would be decentralized
Stephane 2: (19:32) excep for euhm.. example the name and ip of the institution?
Pedro (PT): (19:32) exactly
Stephane 2: (19:33) and than based on that sending the info and getting the info
Pedro (PT): (19:33) but if thats the only thing descentralized
Pedro (PT): (19:33) is it realy necessary?
Pedro (PT): (19:33) can you find more things that migth be needed in a central repository?
Stephane 2: (19:33) you have to be able to communicate to the other
Stephane 2: (19:33) how will you else start initial communication,
Pedro (PT): (19:33) as i sayd
Stephane 2: (19:34) sending a mail asking for the ip?
Pedro (PT): (19:34) partner ship must be made first
Pedro (PT): (19:34) on doing that by phone email or w/e
Pedro (PT): (19:34) they manualy add
Pedro (PT): (19:34) the new institution
Pedro (PT): (19:34) the program has an input box for the administrator
Pedro (PT): (19:34) where you put the name and url
Stephane 2: (19:34) yes
Pedro (PT): (19:34) for example
Stephane 2: (19:35) it seems a good solution
Pedro (PT): (19:35) because having to monitor a central thing
Pedro (PT): (19:35) creating sync deamon alerts etc
Pedro (PT): (19:35) jsut for that
Pedro (PT): (19:35) to much work for nothing
Stephane 2: (19:35) yes maybe
Stephane 2: (19:35) okay
Stephane 2: (19:36) so we have that
Stephane 2: (19:37) that part about having a central db holding the ip's and names isn't so imortant now with this new implementation
Pedro (PT): (19:37) yeah
Pedro (PT): (19:37) but the part of the rest of the info being separeted is i believe
Pedro (PT): (19:37) so now you have to choose between
Pedro (PT): (19:37) getting the info once and storing in your db
Pedro (PT): (19:38) or accessing it when necessary
Stephane 2: (19:38) hmm
Stephane 2: (19:39) if you should ask everytime for a connection to a db in another institution will be going slow
Stephane 2: (19:39) would be a good solution to store the info as long as you're on erasmus?
Stephane 2: (19:39) and when finished deleting entry from db?
Arne R 2: (19:39) btw: if you want to contact me beside the meeting, feel free to add me over jabber/xmpp: turkleton@jabber.ccc.de
Pedro (PT): (19:40) ok stephane
Arne R 2: (19:40) in germany we have privacy laws that say: data has to be deleted when you don't need it anymore
Pedro (PT): (19:40) but which kind of info are you allowed to store
Pedro (PT): (19:40) and how do you make shure it is deleted after
Pedro (PT): (19:41) this is to bring up those law problems
Stephane 2: (19:41) hmm, now you too have to fill in your personal data on those forms
Stephane 2: (19:41) and those formsmust be kept for 5 years
Arne R 2: (19:42) for example: when you buy something from an online store they are allowed to store your data for the time of the process. after sending the good and receiving the payment they have to delete all personal data
Arne R 2: (19:43) there must be a policy of the erasmus institution itself which says how long you have to save the data
Stephane 2: (19:43) if people start to mess with the application, is that our fault?
Stephane 2: (19:43) you can't prevent people from doing bad things
Pedro (PT): (19:43) not necessarely
Pedro (PT): (19:43) but you can present some counter measures
Pedro (PT): (19:43) you do want to make a good product
Stephane 2: (19:43) yes
Stephane 2: (19:43) but as i said
Stephane 2: (19:44) when you go on erasmus now, you still have to fill in those forms with your pesonal data which is sent to that institution
Stephane 2: (19:44) and there you can't also prevent people from copying that or using that info
Pedro (PT): (19:44) yes
Pedro (PT): (19:45) but you can round down the number of peaplo
Pedro (PT): (19:45) people*
Pedro (PT): (19:45) able to do that
Pedro (PT): (19:45) if you present only 1 weak link (the admin)
Pedro (PT): (19:45) its esier to find the culprit
Pedro (PT): (19:45) stuff like that
Stephane 2: (19:45) only the admin will be able to access the php files/db i think
Pedro (PT): (19:46) create logs for when sensible data is copied
Pedro (PT): (19:46) etc
Pedro (PT): (19:46) it is perfectly reasenable to do this
Pedro (PT): (19:46) i am just pointing out the implications
Pedro (PT): (19:46) that will affect mostly germany
Pedro (PT): (19:47) they can say its to complicated for the time we have
Pedro (PT): (19:47) or have a better ideia etc etc
Pedro (PT): (19:47) but still some data is always stored for the out package i belive
Pedro (PT): (19:47) the name of the student, where he comes from and what course and mobility he has
Pedro (PT): (19:48) is there any more relevant info for the host institution to hold?
Stephane 2: (19:48) Am i wrong to say it makes perfect sense to hold the data of the incoming students while they are at the host institution?
Pedro (PT): (19:48) ups i meant the in package
Pedro (PT): (19:49) no your not wrong
Pedro (PT): (19:49) but what data are we talking about
Pedro (PT): (19:49) is it complex? is it simple has i pointed out?
Pedro (PT): (19:49) greece has to enter here pls (their p-in right? lol)
Stephane 2: (19:49) all the data that need to be filled in on the application/learnign agreement form




Stephane 2: (19:51) so obviously it does
Stephane 2: (19:51) else they wouldn't ask you to do it
Stefanos (Greece): (19:51) since the user is active we have to keep the data. he must have the option to sign out. also, we can have a cronjob to delete inactive uers
Pedro (PT): (19:51) ok
Pedro (PT): (19:52) so seems it needs to be stored
Pedro (PT): (19:52) in this particular case those problems of having names from other ocuntrys etc still aply?
Pedro (PT): (19:52) i ask you germany the strict laws country
Stephane 2: (19:54) it can't be a problem, how else are you applying for an erasmus project, you can't say 'I have here a John Doe' applying for Erasmus
Pedro (PT): (19:54) i assume so to
Pedro (PT): (19:54) but htere are some crazy countrys out there
Pedro (PT): (19:54) example in germany you get arrested for 3 years if you blow an atomic bomb O.o
Stephane 2: (19:55) lols
Arne R 2: (19:55) sorry, were afk...moment please
Stephane 2: (19:56) the main problem when we asked for a centralized db was that eveyone could see the info of an eramus student - even he wasn't from your institution or in your institution
Stephane 2: (19:56) but now we see that a decentralized is the best option
Stephane 2: (19:56) we don't have that problem anymore
Stephane 2: (19:57) when you apply for a partnership with an institution you have some restrictions to obey
Stephane 2: (19:57) such as: not abusing personal data
Pedro (PT): (19:57) i can't help you there
Pedro (PT): (19:57) i also believe its like that
Pedro (PT): (19:57) but between believing and knowing theres a ig gap
Stephane 2: (19:58) we asked our international office and teacher, maybe one of you guys should ask it
Stephane 2: (19:58) but you have to be reasonable too, you can't go on erasmus and expectin not to share any data
Stephane 2: (19:58) if something goes wrong, who do they contact
Pedro (PT): (19:59) yers
Pedro (PT): (19:59) soem data is always shared
Stephane 2: (19:59) it's only logic thay have that info
Pedro (PT): (19:59) i was just asking if ALL is shared
Pedro (PT): (20:00) so given this ocnsiderations the actual schema of the DB still holds up i believe?
Pedro (PT): (20:00) this would only affect syncing info between institutions
Stephane 2: (20:00) i guess so, because all the data that is being kept in the database we got from the official ects forms
Arne R 2: (20:01) if there is a need to save personal data by a public institution there will be no problems with laws
Arne R 2: (20:01) a justified need
Pedro (PT): (20:02) ok now a question should a student be able to login on both isntitutions sites when in an erasmus? i say no because its mostly useless
Arne R 2: (20:02) and the institutions have to confess to privacy laws when they want to use our piece of software
Arne R 2: (20:03) hmmm...
Stephane 2: (20:03) so we are good?
Stephane 2: (20:03) :)
Arne R 2: (20:03) it would be good to have somebody who has some erasmus experience..
Stephane 2: (20:03) hmm
Stefanos (Greece): (20:03) aggeliki has experiance 
Arne R 2: (20:03) to get to know what it necessary in the exchange process
Arne R 2: (20:04) *is
Pedro (PT): (20:04) why stepahne feeling like straching your legs :P?
Pedro (PT): (20:04) streaching*
Pedro (PT): (20:05) in what regard? did she do erasmus already?
Stephane 2: (20:05) no, i just wondered wether we were good with the info we are holding because again, all the info we stored in the db came from the official erasmus forms
ageliki: (20:05) yes
Stephane 2: (20:05) and we can't delay to long on certain things because we don't have that mmuch time
Pedro (PT): (20:05) then talk no wait yell!!
Pedro (PT): (20:06) you have more knowladge than us hehe
ageliki: (20:06) :P
Pedro (PT): (20:06) ok one point seems to be over to
Pedro (PT): (20:06) deployment wont affect the DB
Pedro (PT): (20:06) every1 agrees?
Pedro (PT): (20:07) a little off tipic to the greeks
Pedro (PT): (20:07) who nkows creete best?
Pedro (PT): (20:07) dam so many typos...
Arne R 2: (20:08) yep agreed
Stephane 2: (20:08) about the login in both institutions
Stephane 2: (20:09) you mean not able to login at both institutions when you're in one or the other?
Pedro (PT): (20:09) nah it was dumb ideia
Pedro (PT): (20:10) its not like your going to china and would be unable to acess foreign websites
Pedro (PT): (20:10) lets keep it simple
Pedro (PT): (20:10) hehe
Pedro (PT): (20:11) i still want my offtopic who knows creete island the best? aggeliki or stefanos
Stephane 2: (20:11) :)
Arne R 2: (20:12) i've been to creete years ago
Stephane 2: (20:12) btw, i wanted to add a boolean to the institution which would determine if they allow internship/studying or the combination of both
ageliki: (20:12) stefanos is from creta
Stephane 2: (20:13) good idea, yes no?
Arne R 2: (20:13) but i was 12 years old...my only interest was the mediteran sea :)
Stefanos (Greece): (20:14) where is creta?
Pedro (PT): (20:14) @ stephane it can be useful yea
Pedro (PT): (20:14) @ off topic i am asking for this because i am trying to plan
Pedro (PT): (20:14) the suposed vacations
Stefanos (Greece): (20:14) come here in hersonisos
Pedro (PT): (20:14) already contacted laura from the blue team to ask if they want
Pedro (PT): (20:14) to plan this together with us
Stefanos (Greece): (20:14) girls beers ;)
Stephane 2: (20:15) we also asked our teacher if we could reschedule an exam to go sooner to greece because we can only stay 2 days longer in greece after the presentation because we have to do a presntation at our school too
Pedro (PT): (20:15) is hersonisos close to chania?
Stefanos (Greece): (20:15) thats a  good idea
Stefanos (Greece): (20:16) @off topic no
Pedro (PT): (20:16) because i saw a beach there that i would kill to go hehe
Stefanos (Greece): (20:16) chania is for old people
Stefanos (Greece): (20:16) no party
Pedro (PT): (20:16) going sooner? hmmmmmm
Pedro (PT): (20:17) i behave a little like old people at night unfortunaly :P 
Stefanos (Greece): (20:17) ;)
Pedro (PT): (20:17) going sooner cuts from project time that i belive we will need
Pedro (PT): (20:17) and we wont enjoy it the best i believe with the stress of the presantation
Stefanos (Greece): (20:18) you'll meet the russian girls and you wont feel old :D
Stefanos (Greece): (20:18) lets get back to work
Stefanos (Greece): (20:18) because its 22:30 here and i'm getting sleppy :D
Stephane 2: (20:19) yes, i kknow it's not ideal but we would love to stay longer but due to that presentation we have to give in school :/





Stephane 2: (20:19) yes, i kknow it's not ideal but we would love to stay longer but due to that presentation we have to give in school :/
Stephane 2: (20:19) but indeed, let's get back to work :(
Pedro (PT): (20:19) yea
Pedro (PT): (20:20) ill probably open a topic OR create a new forum if the blue team wants to do this together
Pedro (PT): (20:20) specialy for this
Stefanos (Greece): (20:20) yep
Pedro (PT): (20:20) onto the work well id say now its up mostly to checking the forms involved and keeping the integrety
Stephane 2: (20:20) do you guys (portugal/greece) need to add something? we have some minor things to add/edit but maybe you should go first
Stephane 2: (20:21) germany also :)
Stefanos (Greece): (20:21) i have some questions about the forms..
Stefanos (Greece): (20:21) :D
Pedro (PT): (20:21) shoot it then
ageliki: (20:22) about the tanscript of records
ageliki: (20:23) it is supposed to get   the data from the base,right?
ageliki: (20:23) i mean we don t have to fill anything\
Pedro (PT): (20:23) stephane your up
Stephane 2: (20:24) yes yes :)
Stephane 2: (20:24) euhm
Stephane 2: (20:24) it should get the data from the bas yes
Stephane 2: (20:24) db*
Stefanos (Greece): (20:24) should we make a list so the admin could see all the records?
Stefanos (Greece): (20:25) like a panel
Stephane 2: (20:26) euhm hwo do you mean?
Stephane 2: (20:26) like per student a view of the records seprated from the form or?
Stefanos (Greece): (20:26) where he can see the students for using this form
Stephane 2: (20:27) when he fills in the students name, the records should be filled in
Stephane 2: (20:27) if that's possible
Stefanos (Greece): (20:28) ...
Stephane 2: (20:29) or another way would be having a list of students who are finishing their erasmus and have grades for the courses they took
Stephane 2: (20:30) and than when you click on a name, redirect then to the transcript of records
Stefanos (Greece): (20:30) that i was thinking about
Stephane 2: (20:30) and then in the showmethod for the transcript of records filling in the info
Stephane 2: (20:30) yes
Stefanos (Greece): (20:30) list of all of students name
Stefanos (Greece): (20:30) where he can search and select the name
Stefanos (Greece): (20:30) ..
Stephane 2: (20:31) and then when he click on it he will be redirected to the transcript of records formpage where the grades and so on are being filled in based on the name you clicked, yes?
Stefanos (Greece): (20:31) yes
Stefanos (Greece): (20:32) he only adds the grades
Stefanos (Greece): (20:32) ..
Stephane 2: (20:32) yes
Stephane 2: (20:32) would be great
Stephane 2: (20:32) we also try to do as many things automatically
Stefanos (Greece): (20:32) yep...
Stephane 2: (20:33) we're almost finished with the pre-candidate part
Stephane 2: (20:33) and the learning agreement and student application form is also finished (or as good as)
Stefanos (Greece): (20:34) ..
