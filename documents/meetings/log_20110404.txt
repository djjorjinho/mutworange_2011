Stephane: (20:12) And had a meeting with our teachers about the signature part and the pre-candidate part
Stephane: (20:12) the signature part: we should ask our internation office which forms are important to be signed and which not --> we have a meeting next thursday about that
Stephane: (20:14) also: we need to find a common layout for the pre-candidate OR find a system where every institution can create hos own pre-candidate form but that's to discuss after everyone has given his report

Stephane: (20:36) so no worries
Arne R.: (20:36) ok, i see my mistake
Stephane: (20:36) didn't*
Arne R.: (20:36) i didn't read the header of the msg
Arne R.: (20:37) but we have good news for you
Stephane: (20:37) ah nice
Stephane: (20:37) deisgn?
Arne R.: (20:37) yes
Stephane: (20:37) design*
Stephane: (20:37) db?
Stephane: (20:37) infox ;)
Arne R.: (20:37) 2 drafts are ready and you have to decide
Stephane: (20:37) great
Stephane: (20:37) show me show me
Arne L (Germany): (20:38) http://orne.de/mutw/template1/
Arne L (Germany): (20:38) http://orne.de/mutw/template2/
Arne R.: (20:40) your opinion on this?
Stephane: (20:40) maybe a stupid question
Ina: (20:40) ou... i love the orange one :)
Stephane: (20:40) but what's difference between 1 and 2?
Stephane: (20:40) okay, srr wait
Ina: (20:41) may be with the banner of the second
Stephane: (20:43) I prefer the one with orange and blue
Stephane: (20:43) but I have the feeling something is missing
Arne R.: (20:43) you prefer no1?
Stephane: (20:44) yes
Arne L (Germany): (20:44) i like the black more
Stephane: (20:44) the problem with the black one is that i have the feeling it's not finished
Arne L (Germany): (20:45) yeah...not completly...the subnavbar is not finished...the rest ist
Nathan: (20:46) i also prefer the black one
Arne R.: (20:46) there is some adjustment needed, but the structure is finished and ready
Arne L (Germany): (20:48) infox is also done a lot...i started creating a module in plonk...so all you have to do is calling the module, giving some information via post (which table is affected and which data will be send)
Stephane: (20:50) god I hate this internetconnection
Stephane: (20:51) how are you sending the data?

Arne R.: (20:51) curl
Stephane: (20:53) never heard of it
Stephane: (20:53) checking it out right now
Arne L (Germany): (20:53) its a hole package of php
Arne L (Germany): (20:53) like the hole mysql-functions
Stephane: (20:53) so you can send data, and how do you receive it?
Arne L (Germany): (20:54) there is a php-script on the other server. this will be called and it will process all data to the database. it gives back a string (success/error) 
Stephane: (20:55) hmm, looks good, great it's still being developed
Arne L (Germany): (20:56) you can do http for the first time, later, when everything works, we can also switch to https
Arne R.: (20:56) it's secure, fast and simple
Arne L (Germany): (20:57) and actually, there is not much data being transfered...only one string
Stephane: (20:58) yes, it looks good but I'm not the best person to make judgement about this part 
Stephane: (20:58) I think iceland would have a better vision on that part
Arne L (Germany): (21:00) yes...maybe...but it was his opinion to take http-connection. and this is a good way and it works very well...
Stephane: (21:00) yes, and the ability to use https is also great
Stephane: (21:01) Yes, maybe you've found the golden egg :)
Stephane: (21:01) i assume you didn't do anything about the database?

Stephane: (21:02) because you worked on the infox and design
Stephane: (21:03) btw, you should create a topic on sourceforge to ask which design everybody wants and than they can make suggestions or so
Arne L (Germany): (21:03) yes...what is with the database? are there some tables missing?
Arne L (Germany): (21:04) yes...arne will do it
Arne L (Germany): (21:04) or has already done it :-)
Stephane: (21:06) euhm there are some tables missing and also so fields
Stephane: (21:06) but we should sit together
Stephane: (21:06) maybe this week
Stephane: (21:07) to finalize the database
Arne R.: (21:08) ok. would you send us a paper what exactly do you need. so we can prepare for the meeting and only have to finalize this
Stephane: (21:08) hmm it's hard to put it on paper
Nathan: (21:08) maybe we can put the missing fields in your database design and then discuss it this week?
Stephane: (21:09) i think it would be better to have a meeting with you, and than all the other parties who are highly involved with the database (greece, belgium, portugal,...)
Arne R.: (21:09) yes, this would be really helpful
Stephane: (21:09) Ina, you're still there?
Stephane: (21:10) Inaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Stephane: (21:10) it's just to know i you would also want to participate in that meeting or not
Stephane: (21:11) no response
Arne L (Germany): (21:11) fall asleep ;-)
Ina: (21:11) here
Stephane: (21:11) nice
Arne L (Germany): (21:11) ahh
Stephane: (21:11) still awake
Ina: (21:11) no...
Ina: (21:11) :X
Stephane: (21:11) :)
Ina: (21:12) i havent got words...
Ina: (21:12) pf
Stephane: (21:12) so, You want to participate in that meeting or are you okay with it that only germany, belgium, greece and portugal would discuss this
Ina: (21:13) when it will be
Stephane: (21:13) I don't know
Ina: (21:13) i need to know in advance, ok?
Stephane: (21:13) sure
Stephane: (21:14) but it will take a while I think to come up wth a final db design
Ina: (21:14) ill try to be there, if you want me
Stephane: (21:14) I want you
Stephane: (21:14) lol
Ina: (21:15) hm.. ok

Arne R.: (21:17) what will be the standard meeting time?
Arne R.: (21:17) 17:30UTC, 18:30UTC? xx:xxUTC?
Stephane: (21:17) 18:30 i suppose
Arne R.: (21:18) ok, so today was an exception?
Stephane: (21:18) apparently
Stephane: (21:18) our bad
Arne L (Germany): (21:19) ok...no prob. i also could have better read your mail...but skipped that part i thought it was clear...
Arne R.: (21:19) no no, it was my mistakte, i didn't read the mail good enough
Stephane: (21:20) euhm, another question, but you can see that also in the log of the meeting i will put on sourceforge, could you ask your school's international office which forms are important to be signed and which ones aren't and does your school provides the possibility to do internships
Stephane: (21:20) because our school doesn't and we don't have those forms
Stephane: (21:20) okay, than no problem :)

Arne L (Germany): (21:23) ok...we will prepare a whitepaper how the infox will work and what type of data you have to pass and how...
Stephane: (21:23) heh?
Arne L (Germany): (21:24) not understandable???
Stephane: (21:24) No because I don't see how that's an answer to my question
Stephane: (21:25) unless the question didn't got through
Arne L (Germany): (21:25) oh...sorry...didnt see that...yes we will check...but you have received the other forms??
Stephane: (21:26) yes, but we need to create an account to have access and that was my last question, is that a problem? and also, do we have to fill in everything in to see the next form OR once we are registered, can we see all the forms?
Arne L (Germany): (21:27) btw...do you have contact to the other team and how far the are gone
