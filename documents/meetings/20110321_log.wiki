Pedro (PT): (3/21/2011 17:06) first of all lets make the status report as planed
Pedro (PT): (17:06) we can start
Pedro (PT): (17:07) WE (p8 package) have already come to an understanding
Pedro (PT): (17:07) of the data warehouse tecnologies that we will be implementing
Pedro (PT): (17:07) and the almost complete sketch of the business model
Pedro (PT): (17:08) we still have some doubts about what data will be stored and what not
Pedro (PT): (17:08) but we are plaining to implement it so your DB isnt affect in any way
Pedro (PT): (17:08) so be prepared to the necessety of caling a method from a class provided by us
Pedro (PT): (17:08) when you register an event liek a submission of a form
Pedro (PT): (17:09) more specefications by the end of the next week
Pedro (PT): (17:09) our next step for the week is to make our DB schema ( relational model - snowflake)
Pedro (PT): (17:10) and start some interface specifications as asked by our coordenator
Pedro (PT): (17:10) and i belive thats it for us for now
Pedro (PT): (17:10) NEXT at random
Stephane: (17:10) or P7?
Pedro (PT): (17:10) belgium your up

Stephane: (17:13) Euhm, we've did some research on which framework we could be using because as P-OUT and also P-IN we will have to code the biggest part of the application
Pedro (PT): (17:14) 2-3min...
Stephane: (17:14) And that's why we would like to use Plonk or Yii and the last one in combination with Smarty
Stephane: (17:15) And we would like to decide that today because we have a lot of coding to do (setting up numerous forms)
Stephane: (17:15) that's out biggest concern for now
Stephane: (17:15) done
Pedro (PT): (17:15) ok good enouth we wil get to that after
Pedro (PT): (17:15) next time prepare the report a little better :P

aggeliki: (17:16) we have 8 forms to prepare and up to nw we have designed the first four using html and j-query
aggeliki: (17:16) we just learned about the frameworks 
aggeliki: (17:17) and we still need to decide about  the final "style" of the applications with the belgian guys
Pedro (PT): (17:18) ok noted the fframework issue
Pedro (PT): (17:18) NEXT iceland

thib: (17:19) We've spent most of the time since Kiel figuring out how to calculate the correlation coff between two corpas
thib: (17:19) so we are basically working the algorithm to do the matching (We are going to go with a weighted form, returning a coff in the range [-1,1] to indicate correlation -> i.e. a match)
thib: (17:20) i'm writing up a tex file with the some of the algo, and it will be done in the next couple of weeks
thib: (17:20) besides that, we have figured out that php has no sane way of supporting callouts to a process running on the service instance, so we are working on a solution to that
thib: (17:21) and as for the other packages, we've prepared mail to the p5, p8 and p9 groups w.r.t. hooks for our application into the web "app"
thib: (17:21) mails*
thib: (17:21) basically, what we need in the databases to be able to our part, and how it needs to be present.

Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:23) ok
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:24) and... that's all we have
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:24) we need some discus with the other
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:24) to start doing something

Arne R - Germany: (17:24) as you may have noticed arne2 and me had/have to write our last exams for the winter term this week so we were more into learning for this. we talked about the framework issue and started working with jquery to get used to it. today i wrote my last exam and arne2 will write his tomorrow so we will meet later this week to write a SQL script which sets up the database for your personal test environment.
Arne R - Germany: (17:25) later next week we will provide three design drafts from which you can choose. maybe we set up a poll or something.
Arne R - Germany: (17:25) a gantt chart is prepared and will be pushed via git later this afternoon.
Arne R - Germany: (17:25) thats it for today, sorry for our lazyness. but we had a hard week :)

Ina Ivanova: (17:29) i like adobe
Pedro (PT): (17:29) ok every1 likes this
thib: (17:29) no?
Pedro (PT): (17:29) y the irc discussion is to an alternate
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:29) what about skype?
thib: (17:29) thats even worse then adobe
Pedro (PT): (17:30) y
Nathan: (17:30) i dont think skype will work with 12 people

Pedro (PT): (17:30) personaly skype is for 4 people max
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:30) It works
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:30) Yesterday I use it for 11 peaople conference call
Stephane: (17:30) chat, mail and sourceforge for exchanging documents
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:30) it was perfect

Pedro (PT): (17:31) y
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:31) ok
Ina Ivanova: (17:31) ok
Arne R - Germany: (17:31) ok: if we use an alternative to this, we should use irc. it's easy to set up, no account needed and i'ts nice plain text based chat. no flash, no window resizing...
Pedro (PT): (17:31) futher discussion to alternates are now made in the forums please
Pedro (PT): (17:31) next issue

Pedro (PT): (17:32) my first one is stephan you report sucked
daniel.lopes: (17:32) thordur mentioned using tex files
Nathan: (17:32) eum, whats wrong with doc, txt?
daniel.lopes: (17:33) that tex file is for the rest of the team or yourselves?
thib: (17:33) hem, that was maybe a mistake, it's going to end up as a pdf.
Stefanos (Greece): (17:33) we should discuss about the form CSS..
aggeliki: (17:34) with the belgians
thib: (17:34) the CSS ?
daniel.lopes: (17:34) if every1 was familiar with latex it would be good but let's stick with pdf/txt
thib: (17:34) you are confusing things here daniel
Nathan: (17:34) uhu, first we need to have the main layout for the site, before we can start designing the forms
thib: (17:35) when it comes to the report: I'd prefer we'd do it in tex. but thats a problem for later.
daniel.lopes: (17:35) yes i agree
Pedro (PT): (17:35) ok
aggeliki: (17:35) ok,nathan we will make a conference during the week...tmr if possible
Nathan: (17:36) but we still need the general layout, colours and so on
Pedro (PT): (17:36) y
Arne R - Germany: (17:36) as i've mentioned in my report, arne2 and me will provide 3 design drafts later next week. these 3 drafts can be discussed and one will be choosen
Pedro (PT): (17:36) but first of all
Pedro (PT): (17:36) bulgaria is behind right now
Nathan: (17:36) ok, thx arne
Pedro (PT): (17:37) i ask of you bulgaria citezens have you anything palned for this week?
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:37) research
Pedro (PT): (17:37) ok i belive you should spend some time this week
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:37) next 2 weeks are for research
Pedro (PT): (17:37) with greece and belgium
Pedro (PT): (17:38) since at least the exams part
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:38) yes
Pedro (PT): (17:38) are similar
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:38) i think we should arenge a meeting with them
Nathan: (17:38) ok, no problem, we are available every day from 9 till 5
aggeliki: (17:39) we are available after 3 every day
thib: (17:39) Same time on mondays works for us.
Ina Ivanova: (17:39) ok
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:39) ok we can discus this later in emails
aggeliki: (17:39) ok
Pedro (PT): (17:39) now onto the framework issue
Nathan: (17:39) ok, perfect
Pedro (PT): (17:40) we wont be seeing php for a while
Pedro (PT): (17:40) so i wont comment on that issue since it wont affect me that much
thib: (17:40) Me and Gummi have no stake in the framework since we'll do very minimal work on the web applications...
Pedro (PT): (17:40) but i belive the ones that are affect should get to an agreement
thib: (17:41) the .be guys are going to be writing most of the php code, I think this should be there decision ?
Nathan: (17:41) so just greece, bulgary, germany and belgium?
Arne R - Germany: (17:41) i agree with thib
Nathan: (17:41) i dont know if the germans will write the exchance in php?
Pedro (PT): (17:41) i belive the bulgary, germany and belgium are on the same page here
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:42) we prefer php
Pedro (PT): (17:42) and greece
thib: (17:42) is there any question about using php ?
Stephane: (17:42) assembler would be cool
Ina Ivanova: (17:42) :x
Stephane: (17:42) no PHP it is
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:42) hahahah
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:42) :)
Nathan: (17:42) i dont think php is still an issue
Nathan: (17:43) just which framework to write our php
aggeliki: (17:43) definetly NOT cool
thib: (17:43) ?
Nathan: (17:44) so php
Nathan: (17:44) ok
Nathan: (17:44) now librarie/framework

Nathan: (17:41) i dont know if the germans will write the exchance in php?
Pedro (PT): (17:41) i belive the bulgary, germany and belgium are on the same page here
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:42) we prefer php
Pedro (PT): (17:42) and greece
thib: (17:42) is there any question about using php ?
Stephane: (17:42) assembler would be cool
Ina Ivanova: (17:42) :x
Stephane: (17:42) no PHP it is
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:42) hahahah
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:42) :)
Nathan: (17:42) i dont think php is still an issue
Nathan: (17:43) just which framework to write our php
aggeliki: (17:43) definetly NOT cool
thib: (17:43) ?
Nathan: (17:44) so php
Nathan: (17:44) ok
Nathan: (17:44) now librarie/framework
Pedro (PT): (17:44) first wohs not familiar with the terms librarie and framework? so we are on the same page
Nathan: (17:44) ok
aggeliki: (17:45) ok
Arne R - Germany: (17:45) i never worked with php frameworks, but i'm familiar with the terms
Ina Ivanova: (17:45) me too
Zvezdimir Tsvyatkov: (17:45) me as well
aggeliki: (17:45) me too
Nathan: (17:46) a framework is basicly a frame to build your site in, so very powerfull, but not so user friendly
Nathan: (17:47) for a library, you can use multiple libraries in your site, for example, phpmailer is a library for mailing, phpgraph for building graphs
Pedro (PT): (17:47) ok se we agree that the decision in design(css,  layout) and framework/libraries are up to belgium bulgarie greece and germany
Arne R - Germany: (17:47) for me it's not a problem to work with a framework, but I can't help you to choose one. this matter should be decided by people how know pros and cons to give us the best advice
Nathan: (17:47) you just include them in your project and you can use them in your code
Nathan: (17:48) the plonk library we have from our school is something between a library and a framework, well documented
thib: (17:48) Is is under a suitable license ?
Nathan: (17:48) licence?
daniel.lopes: (17:48) GPL, BSD, MIT
Nathan: (17:49) its just in use our school for now
Arne R - Germany: (17:49) GPL, BSD, MIT or something elsE?
daniel.lopes: (17:49) it must have a license
Nathan: (17:49) its just a library our lecturer wrote
thib: (17:50) If we are going to use it, it needs to have a distribution license
Nathan: (17:50) we asked our lecturer and it was no problem
Nathan: (17:50) srr, BSD license
Nathan: (17:50) my mistake
thib: (17:50) ah! perfect.
Arne R - Germany: (17:50) ok

Arne R - Germany: (17:51) ok thats great nathan
thib: (17:52) Can we discuss a little bit the hierarchy inside our source tree (the git repo) ?
Nathan: (17:52) and build a example with the basic functionality and directore structure 
Nathan: (17:52) example site
Pedro (PT): (17:52) shure
Pedro (PT): (17:52) thib*
daniel.lopes: (17:52) yeah
Nathan: (17:52) if everyone agrees on plonk, me and stephane can put up the basis directory tree and so one
thib: (17:53) fwiw, I think you should just do it. This commitee style of making decisions is going to get us nowhere
Nathan: (17:54) ok, i'll put it on git tonight
thib: (17:54) ok, on to the tree maybe?
Nathan: (17:54) and we can arrange a meeting tomorrow with the members who will most need it
daniel.lopes: (17:55) yes go
Pedro (PT): (17:55) the planning part is simple
Pedro (PT): (17:55) is for the gantt charts
Pedro (PT): (17:55) and any other type of documentation related
thib: (17:56) errh, ok whatever. I dont see the point, but sure. (Like some of hte stuff in meetings/ should be in planning/ etc) it feels mixed up.
thib: (17:56) and whats the presentation dir for ?
thib: (17:56) everything is full of unhelpful README files...
daniel.lopes: (17:57) the presentation directory just serves to make the final presentation later on
thib: (17:58) okey
daniel.lopes: (17:58) I couldn't commit empty directories so I added redundant README files
thib: (17:58) ok, and the proper difference between meetings/ and planning/ is ?
Pedro (PT): (17:59) not shure on the need for meetings
daniel.lopes: (17:59) that was a mixup, the meetings directory should just contain the meeting transcriptions
Pedro (PT): (17:59) but the ideia is to keep somewhere the meetings planing and more importantly the previus meetings sumaries
thib: (17:59) Can I make a suggestion that we nuke both meetings and planning and just call it "docouments" or "stuff" or "dump" or whatever. and seperaate that into the package names ?
thib: (17:59) so every group as one place to dump crud, and call it a day ?
daniel.lopes: (18:00) sure why not
daniel.lopes: (18:00) we'll call it documents
thib: (18:00) documents/ would be good (then you can have documents/meetings/datestamp.txt would be a log of the meeting) 
thib: (18:01) daniel: are you going to handle that ?
daniel.lopes: (18:01) yes i'll do it
thib: (18:01) perfect
thib: (18:01) then the sourcecode goes into erasmusline/ right ?
daniel.lopes: (18:01) If i run into any snag can I get some help from you?
daniel.lopes: (18:01) yes
thib: (18:02) (please please please, don't seperate that into package name sub directories)
daniel.lopes: (18:02) should the name be changed?
thib: (18:02) daniel: sure no problem
thib: (18:02) the "application" is called erasmusline, so I think the name is apt
daniel.lopes: (18:02) wasn't going to
daniel.lopes: (18:03) ok then
thib: (18:03) but there should be ofcourse some logical seperation in there, but yeah.
daniel.lopes: (18:04) agreed
Pedro (PT): (18:04) OH i almost forgot arne 1 (otto) aparantly cant make it to this meetings at 5pm ever apparently
Pedro (PT): (18:04) arne reimer have anything to add?
Pedro (PT): (18:05) did he tell you about hes schedule or something?
Arne R - Germany: (18:05) i'm available every monday, but would be better to arne2 in this meeting too
Arne R - Germany: (18:06) yes
Arne R - Germany: (18:06) he is available from 7:30pm on mondays
Arne R - Germany: (18:06) GMT

thib: (18:12) ok, so whats left?
Nathan: (18:13) database?
Arne R - Germany: (18:13) ok thas me
thib: (18:13) schema or the actual database?
Pedro (PT) (privately): (18:13) i belive acompelte undersatind
Pedro (PT): (18:13) i belive a complete understanding
Pedro (PT): (18:13) of the forms need and how their going to work
Nathan: (18:14) nja i think we still have a lot discussion about the whole database design and implemenation
Pedro (PT): (18:14) is needed before having a full DB model
Pedro (PT): (18:14) hows the pre candi form thing going?
Pedro (PT): (18:14) (note should have been mentioned in the status report, so it wouldnt suck pfft)
Pedro (PT): (18:15) nathan stephan?
thib: (18:15) OK, me and gummy have to head out. We had other engagments at 19:00
Arne R - Germany: (18:16) arne and me will work on the database from tomorrow. we will provide our first results as soon as possible.
Pedro (PT): (18:16) ok thib
Nathan: (18:16) ok
Pedro (PT): (18:16) i belive for you is jsut the coding thing for now
Pedro (PT): (18:16) and the gantt till the next week
Stephane: (18:16) we didn't talk about that
Stephane: (18:16) that's for tomorrow
Pedro (PT): (18:17) ok you still could have sayd no advance has been made
Pedro (PT): (18:17) so for now seems the DB cant be decided yet
