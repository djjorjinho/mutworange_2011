\chapter{Conclusions}
\section{Project Outcome}
After three months of work the Orange Team crossed the finish
line of the 2011 MUTW Project. In the last 103 days the team achieved several goals of this
project and had a productive time working together in a multinational european
team.

The goal of this project was to develop a web-application which covers
all necessary needs for applying for the Erasmus Exchange Process. In more than
30 meetings the team held to discuss the development of the application, fixed
problems and coordinated further work. Beside the specified weekly monday
meetings, several special meetings were held to discuss and fix problems between
the affected teams.

After this hard work, the ErasmusLine application developed
by the Orange Team will certainly fulfill the expectations and is a strong
symbol for multinational european teamwork.
