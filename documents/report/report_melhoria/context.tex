\section{Specifications} \label{sec:specs}

The MUTW Erasmus site – called ErasmusLine – is a web application
providing a platform to support Erasmus mobility of students.

All actors involved in Erasmus mobility, including students, Erasmus
coordinators, International Office and other staff, are granted access to the
platform. The ErasmusLine platform must provide ways to manage all the Erasmus
activity of the institution related to students’ mobility. Supporting the
bureaucratic process accompanying students’ mobility from the application stage
until the academic recognition includes several tasks, such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Inter-institution process documentation exchange
  \item Take exams at host institution
  \item Issue automatic alerts for required actions
  \item Match learning agreement to students’ requirements, with an automatic
  course matching facility
\end{itemize}

Additionally we want to evaluate the performance of institutions and students in
operating these procedures and Erasmus dynamics in each institution. This
involves some extra functionality:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Produce performance statistics
  \item Provide tools to analyze these statistics.
\end{itemize}

The ErasmusLine system is composed by four core areas: \emph{business,
statistics, services} and \emph{configuration}, as depicted in Figure
\ref{img:cores}. \newline

\fig{img/cores.png}{ErasmusLine Core Areas}{img:cores}{0.7}

The business core is responsible for the workflow of Erasmus exchanges, both for
outgoing and incoming students. It includes four packages directly related to
managing the Erasmus processes: “OUT students”, “IN students”, “Exams at host
institution” and “Course Matching”.

The services core provides a set of services available throughout the
ErasmusLine system. These services are deployed by the packages “Information
exchange and security” and “Automatic alerts”.

The configuration core is responsible for assuring that all the required data is
available and coherent. This core is implemented by the “Configuration” package.

The statistical core - developed by the Portuguese team - is an Executive
Information System (EIS) designed to provide statistical information to analyze
the performance of institutions and the interest of students regarding Erasmus
mobility.

These Core Areas include 8 distinct packages, depicted in Figure
\ref{img:packages}:

\fig{img/packages.png}{ErasmusLine Package Distribution}{img:packages}{0.7}

\begin{description}

\item[P1-CONFIG]
This package is responsible for parameter and entity management. All other
packages will rely on this one to get validated, coherent data required to
operate the system. User accounts and user profiles are also managed by this
package.

\item[P2-INFOX]
This package allows exchanging documents and students’ processes between
instances of the ErasmusLine application.

\item[P3-ALERT]
This package generates automatic alerts for pending tasks. These alerts are
triggered by timeouts associated to requests that are not answered in due time.

\item[P4-OUT]
This package assists \textbf{outgoing} students, home coordinators and staff in
the management of the exchange process from pre-candidacy to the conversion of the
ECTS credit to a local scale.

\item[P5-IN]
This package assists \textbf{incoming} students, host coordinators and staff in
the management of the exchange process from application submission to the
issuing the transcript of records.

\item[P6-EXAM]
Whenever Erasmus students have mandatory courses, for which there are no
interchange options in the host institution, they can request to take the exam
on that course at the host institution.

\item[P7-MATCH]
This package will perform an automatic matching of courses based on textual
descriptions offered by the host institution and the student’s needs.

\item[P8-STATS]
This package deploys an Executive Information System that collects operational
data and exposes it to users through a set of statistical indicators designed to
provide ways to evaluate the performance of these processes, to identify
critical tasks and to evaluate the Erasmus impact and progress in the
institutions.

\end{description}

\section{P8-STATS Erasmus Statistics}
This statistics module – an Executive Information System (EIS) – is responsible
for collecting operational data from ErasmusLine databases and, eventually, from
some external sources, in order to compute performance statistics that comply
with the objectives to be controlled. It should also provide an interface that
exposes these indicators to users and allows them to perform analyses on this
data without requiring any specific statistical knowledge and yet being able to
identify potential problems and/or opportunities.

\subsection{Objectives}

The statistics package of ErasmusLine should provide information directed to the
following objectives:

\begin{description}
\item[Erasmus efficiency:] focused on the institution ability as an ``Erasmus
provider'' or ``Erasmus facilitator'' to students. This objective is directed to
evaluate the institution’s Erasmus profile, i.e., to what extent is the
institution promoting Erasmus and supporting Erasmus students. (Is the
institution doing the right things?)

\item[Erasmus efficacy:] focused on the outcomes arising from the institution
efforts towards Erasmus. This objective is directed to evaluate whether the
institution is improving its own Erasmus dynamics. (Is the institution doing the
things right?)
\end{description}

These objectives should be evaluated by determining \emph{Key Performance
Indicators}, quantifiable \emph{Measures} and defining various \emph{Dimension}
from which to analyse the information from several points of view.

\subsection{Deployment Procedure}

As a guideline to design the EIS, a simple procedure is detailed below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define objectives.
\item Define indicators for each objective, dimensions (together with their
 hierarchical structure) and measures. Cross indicators with dimensions and with measures. 
\item Design the EIS: set the indicators and their sources of information,
set facts and dimensions, set measures, collect exogenous information, identify
and specify synchronization procedures (these will be highly dependent on the
operational database), setup a data model (star/snowflake schema), design
interface/layout, specify available functionality
\item Deploy the data model for the EIS
\item Deploy the synchronization procedures
\item Deploy the user interface
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technology Overview}

Before beginning analysis and development of the project's application, the
Orange team decided from the various technologies  listed in the specifications
given the necessity of each task that was needed to complete this project.
During this project, the team relied solely on Open Source Technologies as
intended by the specifications. These technologies are not abridged by copyleft
licenses like the Gnu Public License, but some remain GPL-compatible.

In the next sections the technologies used are separated by task context and 
specifications wise.

\subsection{Programming languages}

\subsubsection{PHP}

This programming language is a standard language for quickly writing web
applications.  It is a dynamically typed, interpreted language with garbage
collection and supports Object Oriented Programming, providing a syntax similar
to older programming languages like C and Perl.

The project is essentially be written in this programming language, given that
is the most easy to setup and learn amongst academics.

\subsubsection{Plonk}

For basic application workflow, the application uses the Plonk library - a
subset of the Spoon\footnote{http://www.spoon-library.com/} library - that
automates functionalities like page routing, session handling and page
templating.

\subsubsection{Python}

The Python programing language is an interpreted, dynamically typed programming
language with garbage collection, used in the P7-MATCH package for it's use of
the Natural Language Toolkit.

\subsubsection{NLTK}

The Natural Language Toolkit is a Python suite of libraries designed for natural
language processing, convenient for matching students' courses and equivalents
between HEI's.

\subsubsection{JavaScript}

Javascript is an interpreted, dynamic and weakly typed programming language
mostly used in client side (Web Browser) scripting. It has some Object Oriented
support with garbage collection. This project uses javascript to reduce
server-side load by performing tasks like form validation, generating content,
Ajax3 calls to the server, etc.

\subsubsection{jQuery}

jQuery is a pluggable javascript library that speeds up client-side script
development by implementing a Domain Specific Language capable of quickly
processing XHTML DOM elements for various aesthetic purposes. It also provides
convenient functions prepared for Ajax communication or pre-programmed plugins
like calendars, color picker windows, etc. 

\subsection{Other Languages}
 
\subsubsection{XHTML}

This is a markup language used to design websites in similar fashion to regular
HTML but with stricter rules, and similar functionalities to XML, for example,
the use of namespaces. 

This project uses XHTML version 1.0 of it's Transitional
guidelines. Given it's more strict nature a common Web Browser will waste less
time processing web page content. 

Making a website that will be used by
thousands of students brings the concern of usability and accessibility. The
ErasmusLine project's Website will be developed under the guidelines of the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (version 2) and strive for a minimum first
level of acceptance. 

\subsubsection{CSS}

This stylesheet language changes the presentation aesthetic of websites in a non
intrusive way, this way being able to switch style configuration rapidly without
touching the markup language files.

\subsection{Databases}

\subsubsection{MySQL}

A relational database system designed for speed and rapidly building
content-oriented websites. This technology serves as the persistent data layer
in the application for various tasks such as the workflow of the Erasmus
Process, the users and students management, to the Data Warehousing used in the
P8-STATS package.

\subsection{Development Platforms}

\subsubsection{SourceForge}

A project hosting website and development platform,
SourceForge\footnote{http://sourceforge.net/} provides infrastructures for the developers to quickly setup a project and use a varied number of features like
source code management systems, mailing list systems, forums, project management
applications, Wiki applications, etc.

\subsection{Development Tools}

\subsubsection{Git}

A distributed source code management system used to keep track and monitor
source code versions, allowing the developer to determine release versions,
track code errors and share application code between other developers
distributed around the world.

This system saves the code in containers called repositories. Each time a
developer wishes to save a change made to the code, he commits file changes to
the local repository. A record of differences is then saved in the repository
along with a short description of the author. When the user is ready to share
their code changes with the rest of the team, he pushes those changes to the
central repository on the SourceForge site, so that other team members can pull
those changes into their local repositories.

Git was available to the project via SourceForge, which also provided an online
interface to check out repository activity and provided a RSS feed so that users
can be notified of recent changes to the code.

During the development of this project the team used the Git repository to keep
a record of the project planning, meetings reports, user manuals, the project
presentation and this project report, along with the applications code.

A usage example would consist of the following scenario (using a terminal
console):

\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In a fresh installation, the developer would start by creating a copy of
  the SourceForge repository and subsequent directory structure and files, using the following command:
  \begin{lstlisting}
git clone git://mutworange.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/mutworange/mutworange
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item After making changes to the code, the developer would issue a commit:
  \begin{lstlisting}
git commit -a -m "fixed a bug in the X package"
  \end{lstlisting}
  Those changes would be saved locally.
  \item After making sure the code changes worked, the developer can share the
  changes with the team:
	\begin{lstlisting}
git push origin master
	\end{lstlisting}
Those changes would be merged with the central repository
  \item When new code changed are pushed to the central repository, the user can
  fetch them using the command:
	\begin{lstlisting}
git pull
	\end{lstlisting}
This fetches the latest changes to the code and merges them with your current
local work.
\end{enumerate}

Git also provides code branching functionality, which consists in creating an
alternate version or path in the application development. Branches are good for
creating new features on pre-existing code, but these features cannot be merged
yet with the “master” branch.

Another feature offered by Git is code tagging, enabling to checkout various
application versions of a branch in a certain context, for example a tag called
\emph{milestone-1} or \emph{release-1.2} would correspond to a point were code
development stopped and is ready to be deployed to the servers.

Source code management systems ensure that a team of developers keeps track of
their work in an effective and efficient way.

\subsubsection{Eclipse / NetBeans}
Integrated Development Environments like NetBeans and Eclipse provide an
interface for code editing for various programming languages and has a set of
plugins to integrate other features in the interface, such as integrated Git
repository management without resorting to terminal commands.

\subsection{Other Tools}

\subsubsection{Total Validator}

A cross-platform application designed to validate Web Sites
against established W3C standards. This application not only validates code for
XHTML but also validates Web Site \index{accessibility} guidelines, according to
the WCAG 2.0 specifications. Has a bare minimum, the Erasmusline application was
validated against \index{WCAG} 2.0 level A, but the application also validates
on levels AA and AAA where applied.

\subsubsection{Delivery}

This application tries to make Javascript files smaller by removing comments,
spaces and new lines to provide faster downloads by the Web Browsers.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}

During the course of this project some team members used Google Docs to write
technical reports that would later serve to compile into this final report.
Google Docs allowed the team members to create and edit text documents
concurrently and in real time with no fear of corrupting the documents. Google
Docs also supported versioning, which enabled us to see, for example, which team
member edited which part of the document.

\subsubsection{Cacoo}

An online, realtime collaborative drawing tool which various team members can
use to produce UML diagrams, draw software deployment plans, etc. and was used
in several points of this project.

\subsubsection{MySQL Workbench}

This tool helps the user design and project databases in a visual way by
creating Entity Relation models of the tables, specifying relational
constraints, create and edit indices, creating user roles and permissions,
default values for tables, etc. and later export those properties to a SQL file
to be immediately imported to a MySQL server.


\subsection{Conventions}

For the sake of usability this projects web-site and database content will be
using the UTF-8 character set encoding. This was a major concern since some
Erasmus partners use different alphabets – for example Greek and Turkish - and
the team had to use a   universal character set that accepted the various
alphabets existent in the European Continent. 

Other conventions were merely determined for development comprehension of the
team. While editing code the team member would have to follow a series of
guidelines to ensure that everyone could understand his code when reading it.
Some of these conventions were:

\begin{itemize}
  \item using UpperCamelCase on object class names 
  \item using lowerCamelCase on class methods
  \item documenting classes and methods using PHPDoc
  \item keep the code lines to a 80 character minimum, the excess code would be
  put in the following lines 
  \item opening brackets in the first line of the code statement
  \item everything else must have the default behavior enforced by the IDE, text
  editor, etc.
\end{itemize}

These conventions ensured the whole team understood each other and understood
what was being developed. While developing the Application Interface it was very
important when designing the stylesheets not to interfere with the default
behavior of the XHTML interface elements. It was agreed that default behavior
would be left intact and set additional behavior by conventionally extending
these said behaviors. This way it was ensured that when the team members
developed in isolation, no necessary code rewrite would be needed.
