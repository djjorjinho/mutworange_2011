= Executive Information Systems =

Executive Information Systems (EIS) are Information Systems that access large ammounts of business information from various sources - internal and external to the organization - and provides decision support mediums to the organizion's senior executives.

These mediums permit the executive managers to highlight patterns in the business process by analysing, comparing and determining trends in the provided mediums - speadsheets, graphic charts, pivot tables, reports, etc.

As an example of EIS use, consider the following scenario:

Erasmus administrators can do a weekly check on student enrollment information. Using a web browser, they can access that information in a personalized fashion by presentiong subsets of the information - views. These views can be "drilled-down" to minute levels of information or "rolled-up" to display a broader view.

Since executive users are not necessarily data analysts, the EIS user interface must be as simple as possible, but without sacrificing presentation dynamics.

With these criteria in mind, the following key requirements for an EIS where identified:

* Cross Platform 
* Ease of Use 
* Limited Training 
* Quick Response 
* Large Volumes of Data 
* Deployment Through the Web 
* Easy Graphical Presentation Options 
* Ability to Access Subsets of Data (Drill Down)
