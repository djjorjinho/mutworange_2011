            Dear European Colleague,

            You have been supervising students of KaHo Sint-Lieven during their Socrates/Erasmus student exchange period.
            The KaHo Sint-Lieven has introduced the European Credit Transfer Sytem. For this reason,
            we would like you to complete this ECTS evaluation form before the end of the exchange period and to return this form to the contact person in KaHo Sint-Lieven with whom  you have organised this exchange.
        </p>
        
        <div class="TRdiv">
        <label for="date"><span><strong>by (date to be completed): </strong></span></label>
        <input class="validate[required,custom[date]] text-input" type="text" id="date" name="date" value="{$date|htmlentities}"/>
        <span class="req">*</span>
        </div>

        <p>
            Thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.
            With European greetings,

        </p>
